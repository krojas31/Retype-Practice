# MarkDown Tutorial

## Heading

To make a heading using markdown you must simply use a `#` sign.

```
# H1
## H2
### H3
All the way down to ###### H6
```

### Example Heading

For example, the example heading above was written with `### Example Heading`

## Bold

To **bold** text use two asterisks on either side of your input.

```
**This text is bold**
```

Output:

**This text is bold**

Similar alternatives to **bold** are `code` and _italics_ and [links]()

See: [code](), [italic](#italic), [links]()

## Italic

To *italicize* text use one asterisks on either side of your input or an underscore.

```
*This text is italics*
_This text is also italicized_
```

_This text is also italicized_

Similar alternatives to *italic* are `code` and **bold** and [links]()

See: [code](), [bold](#bold), [link]()

## Blockquote

To use a blockquote use a chevron `>` before each line of text.

```
> Note
> 
> This is a blockquote
```

Output:

> Note

> This is a blockquote

## Ordered List

To use an ordered list you may either type consecutive numbers or `1` over and over.

```
1. This is 1
2. This is 2
3. This is 3
---
1. This is 1
1. This is 2
1. This is 3
```

Output:
1. This is 1
2. This is 2
3. This is 3

To use code simply add a backtick `` ` `` around your line of code
