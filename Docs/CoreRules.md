# Core Rules

## Long Jump

You can perform a Long Jump up to a distance equal to 5x your Strength Modifier if you've moved at least 10ft, on foot, before the jump, otherwise your Long Jump distance is cut in half.

**Example:** A character with a +5 Strength Modifier can Long Jump 25ft (5x5).

## High Jump

You can perform a High Jump up to a number of feet equal to 1 + your Strength Modifier if you've moved at least 10ft, on foot, before the jump, otherwise your High Jump height is cut in half.

**Example:** A character with a +4 Strength Modifier can High Jump 5ft (4+1).

### *High Jump - Reach*

Whether a character is 4ft-tall or 7ft-tall, if they both have a +4 Strength Modifier then they both have a High Jump of 5ft. Their height is what makes all the difference for how high they can reach while jumping. Here is the formula for figuring out how high a character's hand could reach, if they were trying to jump up and grab a high ledge.

While performing a High Jump, your total reach is a number of feet equal to 1 + your Strength Modifier added to 1.5 x your height

**Example:** A character with a +4 Strength Modifier, that is 6ft-tall could jump and reach a total height of 14ft: 1 + 4 (Str Mod) + 9 (6ft x 1.5 for the height).
